\section{Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:chap_slam_data_acquisition}

In the following section, we first describe the robotic platform and sensors used to gather our place recognition dataset. We then describe in more details the dataset acquisition procedure and the resulting data.


\subsection{Robotic platform}
\label{ssec:chap_slam_platform}

The Husky A200 is a medium size (990 x 670 x 390 \SI{28}{\milli\meter}) \gls{ugv} developed by Clearpath Robotics~\cite{ClearpathWeb}. It is a rugged robot designed for all terrain conditions, therefore well suited for our experiments in forest. It uses a differential-drive skid steer allowing easy control and in place turns for our data acquisition. It has a maximum speed of \SI{1}{\meter\per\second}, but we generally acquire data at lower speed, which minimizes odometry and range data errors. This platform, with a maximum payload capability of \SI{75}{\kilo\gram}, can easily carry all sensors used for our experiments. The platform is shown in figure~\ref{fig:chap_slam_husky} and more details about the available devices are presented in table~\ref{tab:husky_devices} show a list of devices available on the platform and the use we make of them.

The on-board computer is an essential element of our experiments, as it connects all devices, acts as a control interface for the robot and stores acquired data. The computer does not provide a \gls{gui}, but it is connected to the gateway that broadcasts a WiFi network, allowing \gls{ssh} communication. The platform is also equipped with a wireless gamepad, which allows controlling the movements of the latter. Point clouds acquisition is possible using either the SICK LMS151 or the Velodyne HDL-32E. The selected sensor is mounted on the \gls{ptu}, which remains fixed for the Velodyne, but is rotated with the SICK to merge multiple \gls{2d} scans into a single \gls{3d} point cloud.

For our place recognition research, we mainly use the wheel encoder along with the \gls{imu} for odometry estimation.

Note that the \gls{ptu} is hidden by fabric and the on-board computer is mostly occluded by the Velodyne \gls{lidar}.}
