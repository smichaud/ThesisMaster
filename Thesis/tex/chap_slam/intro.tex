\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:chap_slam_intro}

In order to navigate safely and efficiently in their environments, mobile robots have to be able to solve a multitude of problems. An example of such problems is the ability to determine whether the robot is located in a place it visited before or in a new one.  Despite the fact that this question seems relatively elementary, an algorithm that solves the so-called place recognition problem is a powerful tool, that proved to be useful for a wide variety of applications. For instance, multiple robots can cooperate to concurrently build a global map (multi-session mapping) using recognized places as connecting points between the different local maps. The well-known "kidnapped robot" problem, which consists in determining if the robot has been carried to an arbitrary location, can also be solved using a place recognition algorithm. Because such an algorithm does not rely on odometry and allows the robot to locate itself relative to all previously visited places, it is possible to detect this kind of unpredictable change of location. Finally, place recognition algorithms are useful to perform \gls*{slam}. The most obvious use is for a topological representation, where the map consists of places and links between them, but it is also essential for loop closure when using a metric representation. 

In the previous chapter we analyzed the influence of an environment with snowy condition on the \gls*{lidar} data. Following the same idea, we are now interested in the influence of challenging environments when using \gls*{lidar}, but at a higher level. More precisely, we want to evaluate how unstructured environments influence navigation algorithms performance. To this end, we chose to use the state-of-the-art \gls*{lidar}-based place recognition algorithm~\citep{Steder2011b}. The algorithm proved to be successful in structured indoor and semi-structured outdoor environments and we want to evaluate the results for unstructured forest environment. For the experiments, we produced our own datasets in forest, but also in semi-structured conditions for comparison purposes. Section~\ref{sec:chap_slam_data_acquisition} details where and how the datasets were produced, as well as the resulting data. Thereafter, fundamental concepts related to the place recognition algorithm as the algorithm itself will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:chap_slam_algo}. Finally, the results of the comparative analysis will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:chap_slam_results} before we conclude the chapter.
