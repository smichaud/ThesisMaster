From Steder article : 

Place recognition, i.e., the ability to recognize previously seen parts of the environment, is one of the fundamental tasks in mobile robotics. The wide range of applications of place recognition includes localization (determine the initial pose), SLAM (detect loop closures), and change detection in dynamic environments.

place recognition meaning the detection that a robot revisited an already known area

Focus on the fact that we want to evaluate the impact of unstructured environments (vs structured) on place recognition algorithm, so we use state of the art framework. Hypothesis that it will not be as good.
