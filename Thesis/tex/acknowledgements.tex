Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisors Prof. Philippe Giguère and Prof. Jean-François Lalonde, for the continuous support during my Master studies. They seamlessly provided funding and research equipment, they assisted me during the writing, but most of all, they shared their precious knowledge and time to help me reach my goals. 

A very special thanks goes out to François Pomerleau, a Postdoctoral Fellow who taught me a lot about the world of research and helped me learn the essential tools for applied robotics. He always answered my numerous questions patiently and provided me with useful tips for my work, even after leaving our research lab.

I would like to thank my fellow labmates for the help they gave me on multiple projects, the stimulating discussions we had and the fun time we shared during social activities.
