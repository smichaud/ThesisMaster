Autonomous driving vehicles must be able to handle difficult weather conditions in order to gain acceptance. For example, challenging situations such as falling snow could significantly affect the performance of vision or LiDAR-based perception systems. In this paper, we are interested in characterizing the behavior of LiDARs in snowy conditions, as there seems to be little information publicly available. In particular, we present a characterization of the behavior of 4 commonly-used LiDARs (Velodyne HDL-32E, SICK LMS151, SICK LMS200 and Hokuyo UTM-30LX-EW) during the falling snow condition. Data was collected from the 4 sensors simultaneously during 6 snowfalls. Statistical analysis of these datasets indicates that these sensors can be modeled in a probabilistic manner, allowing the use of a Bayesian framework to improve robustness. Moreover, we were able to observe the temporal evolution of the impact of the falling snow during these snowstorms, and characterize the sensitivity of each device. Finally, we concluded that the falling snow had little impact beyond a range of \SI{10}{\meter}.
